🎮 Number Guessing Game

1️⃣ The program generates a random number 🎲 between 1 and 100.
2️⃣ It continuously prompts the user to enter a guess ⌨️.
3️⃣ If the input is not a valid number, it displays ⚠️ "Invalid input! Please enter a valid number."
4️⃣ If the guess is too low, it shows ⬇️ "Too low! Try again."
5️⃣ If the guess is too high, it shows ⬆️ "Too high! Try again."
6️⃣ If the guess is correct, it displays 🎉 "Congratulations! You got it right!" and ends the game.

This loop 🔁 ensures that the game continues until the user correctly guesses the number. 🏆
