This project is a simple countdown timer that takes user input in seconds and counts down to 00:00. It updates the timer in real-time using the time.sleep(1) function and displays the remaining time in MM:SS format.

Key Features:

✅ Uses divmod() to calculate minutes and seconds.

✅ Displays the countdown in the same line for a clean look.

✅ Includes icons/emojis for better user experience.

✅ Handles invalid input errors gracefully.

When the timer reaches zero, it prints "⏰ Time’s Up! 🎉" to notify the user. 🚀
