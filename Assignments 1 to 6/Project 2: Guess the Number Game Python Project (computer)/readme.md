Project 2: Guess the Number Game Python Project (computer) - Python Learning Summary 🎯🔢 This Guess the Number Game is a simple yet powerful Python project that introduces key programming concepts while making learning interactive and fun.

📚 Key Learning Outcomes

🔹 Random Number Generation (random.randint()) – Generate a secret number.

🔹 Loops (while) – Keep the game running until guesses are used up.

🔹 Conditional Statements (if-elif-else) – Check if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

🔹 User Input Handling (input()) – Accept and process user guesses.

🔹 Error Handling (try-except) – Prevent crashes from invalid inputs.

🔹 Formatted Strings (f-strings) – Display remaining attempts dynamically.

🛠️ How the Game Works

1️⃣ The program selects a random number between 1 and 100.

2️⃣ The player has 7 attempts to guess the correct number.

3️⃣ After each guess:

✅ Correct Guess: The game congratulates the player and ends.

❌ Wrong Guess: The game gives hints (Too high! Too low!).

🚨 Invalid Input: The game warns the player and asks for a valid number

. 4️⃣ If the player runs out of attempts, the game reveals the correct number.

🚀 Why This Project is Important?

✅ Teaches control flow & loops (handling user input repeatedly)

✅ Introduces basic AI behavior (computer-generated random number)

✅ Improves user input validation (handling errors gracefully)

✅ Enhances debugging skills through trial and error

✅ Fun & Interactive! Perfect for beginners learning Python
