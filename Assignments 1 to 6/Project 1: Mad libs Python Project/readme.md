Mad Libs Game - Python Learning Summary 🎭📖

This Mad Libs game is a fun beginner-friendly project that helps users learn Python basics while creating an interactive story.

📚 Key Learning Outcomes

🔹 User Input (input()) – Take dynamic input from the user.

🔹 Variables – Store user-provided data (e.g., name, language, mentor).

🔹 Formatted Strings (f-strings) – Use dynamic placeholders in text output.

🔹 String Manipulation – Combine inputs into a structured story.

🔹 Print Statements (print()) – Display an engaging story.

🛠️ How the Game Works

1️⃣ The user provides custom inputs (e.g., name, language, mentor, location).

2️⃣ The program stores these values in variables.

3️⃣ A predefined story template is used, and the inputs are inserted dynamically using f-strings.

4️⃣ The user gets a unique, personalized story based on their inputs.
